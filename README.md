# Dimensioned Library of Tensors
This is a small lib I made for my thermodynamics simulation project. I was fed up with implementing vectors in `uom`. It's very bug prone, experimental but does the job quite well. Inspired by [Terry Tao's post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2012/12/29/a-mathematical-formalisation-of-dimensional-analysis/#xml) and [yuouom](https://github.com/iliekturtles/uom).
